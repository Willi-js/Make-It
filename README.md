## Features

Quickly make the files and folders you want.

If you ARE currently in an open file, you will be making a new directory or file in the directory your currently opened file is located. 

If you are NOT in a file your work directory will be used insted.

Path notations do work. You can use notation like ../{direcotry}/{file}
Keep in mind the location note above.

- **ctrl + n** - `makes a new file`
- **ctrl + d** - `makes a new directory`
